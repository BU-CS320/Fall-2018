# Further Reading

Proofs have the potential to make programing easier.
However, some combination of automation, user interface, theory, and informal convincing needs to happen first

If you have questions, or are interested in working on this then drop me an email, or stop by my office hours.


## Where to go from here?

### Agda
 * a very minimal presentation of these concepts
 * http://people.inf.elte.hu/divip/AgdaTutorial/Index.html
 * plenty of videos


### Idris
 * Agda like, trys to be practical
 * good videos here: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zSsCLnLS1hg

### Coq
 * very academic, more "powerful" but more complicated
 * good introductory stuff: https://softwarefoundations.cis.upenn.edu/


### ATS
 * A (Not So Gentle) Introduction To Systems Programming In ATS by Aditya Siram https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zt0OQb1DBko&t=38s
520...
 * the rest of Introduction to Programming in ATS http://ats-lang.sourceforge.net/DOCUMENT/INT2PROGINATS/HTML/INT2PROGINATS-BOOK-onechunk.html
 * the google groups ats-lang-club, and stackoverflow
 * Talk to Hongwei (or me)


### Haskell
there is an active haskell meetup in the area: https://www.meetup.com/Boston-Haskell/ . They frequently cover these topics.


### Other languages
other dependently typed languages:
lean, isabelle

kind of like Haskel:
SML, ocaml*, scala

*apply at Jane St. https://www.janestreet.com/join-jane-street/process/


other interesting languages:
 * Lisp family (a whole different universe of functional programmers)
 * prolog (a declarative math language)
