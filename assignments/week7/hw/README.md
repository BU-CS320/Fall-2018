# HW Due 10/23
Lab and HW are combined this week.

## Before
If you have time look at https://hackage.haskell.org/package/base-4.11.1.0/docs/Data-Either.html

## Setup
Similar to [lab2](../../week2/lab2), Follow this [link](https://classroom.github.com/a/WMhS3bWk) to create an assignment repository

## Submit
similar to [lab2](../../week2/lab2)

## REPL commands
 * ```:load x``` will load a different module
 * ```:reload``` reloads the module
 * ```:type x``` tells you the type of x
 * ```:q``` quits out of the REPL


## Hints
 * parse smaller things, test and then parse bigger things with the smaller things
 * start early and submit tests
 * refresh the cabal REPL constantly!
 * commit and push to your private repo often
 * check your github private repo that you work has been submitted
 * it is best to pull in form the upstream after you have committed and pushed to your private repo.

## Notes
added some more words and tests after the first lab.
