## REPL commands
 * ```:load x``` will load a different module
 * ```:reload``` reloads the module
 * ```:type x``` tells you the type of x
 * ```:q``` quits out of the REPL


## Hints
 * start early and submit tests!
 * refresh the cabal REPL constantly!
 * commit and push to your private repo often
 * check your github private repo that you work has been submitted
 * it is best to pull in form the upstream after you have committed and pushed to your private repo.

## Notes
 * Will add a few more test cases
