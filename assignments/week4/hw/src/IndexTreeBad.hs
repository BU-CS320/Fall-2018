-- Example 2: Index Table and Inverted Index Table

-- For this problem, you must develop a variation of a dictionary
-- called an index table (or sometimes just "index"); this is exactly
-- the same as a dictionary, except that it must have a list of values
-- associated with it instead of just a single value. Such a data
-- structure is very useful in a wide variety of applications, such
-- as concordances. 
-- In particular, you can "invert" such a tree to create a reverse index.

-- insert attempts to put a key and value in the index;
--     if the key is not there, it adds key and [value];
--     if key is there, but value not, it adds value to list of values;
